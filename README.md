Add a replica of your Exercise model to the backend Spring app. Create a POST route that allows creating a new Exercise, and a GET route that responds with all Exercises currently in the database. Test these routes with Postman, deploy, and ensure thereâ€™s at least one Exercise in your deployed db.
